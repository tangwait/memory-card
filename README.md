memory card project using react template

This was a fun project to review and solidify my understanding of what I've learned so far:

    useState hooks
    passing props
    prop validation
    organizing components
    passing png to deployment

note: stuff in public/ won't be touched by the bundler other than just loading across to dist/ as is. So there won't be file name hashing, file optimisation or anything that Vite may do with its standard config (or any custom config of course).
